# SSAI(or Super Stupid AI)
This is thr repository that shows my small steps forward to creation of NN which
can do something more than telling you the number on the picture. As you may see,
I started right from that point ;)
*To be continued... (at least I hope so)*

## The structure 
You can see two dirs:
* 0_abstraction
* torch<br />
<!-- end -->
The **0_abstraction** dir contains the model that uses no frameworks or libs
for building NN's. The only things used there are **numpy** for data transform, **scipy**
for mathematical functions and matplotlib for displaying data. The model is built with 
basic linear algebra principles (matrix operations) and mathematical analysis (derivative and integral calculations).


The **torch** dir contains NN built with **pytorch** lib.
