# AI_ML_DL
This is the repository that contains my AI|ML|DL code

## The structure 
You can see two dirs:
* 0_abstraction
* torch<br />
<!-- end -->
The **0_abstraction** dir contains the model that uses no frameworks  NN's. The only things used there are **numpy** for data transform, **scipy**
for mathematical functions and matplotlib for displaying data. The model is built with 
basic linear algebra principles (matrix operations) and mathematical analysis (derivative and integral calculations).


The **torch** dir contains NN built with **pytorch** lib.
